The policy requirements have been enhanced to provide more detailed guidance on e-KYC solutions, including requirements on the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning or other forms of predictive algorithms, reliance on human representatives, and additional safeguards for higher risk financial products. This will require the organization to review and update its internal policies and procedures to align with the new regulatory requirements."\n    },\n    {\n        "Num": 2,\n        "Affected Section/Paragraph": "6.2 Data Storage",\n        "Summary of Impact": "New requirements have been introduced for financial institutions to ensure the technology provider appointed to provide the e-KYC solution conducts an external independent assessment on the e-KYC solution in accordance with the minimum scope and criteria specified (section 8.22, Appendix 3).

This includes measures like requiring credit transfers from existing bank accounts and implementing ringfencing parameters to mitigate risks. The organization will need to review and update its processes and controls for higher risk financial products to align with the new regulatory requirements."\n    }\n]'}
