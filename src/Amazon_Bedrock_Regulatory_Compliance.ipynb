      "Technology risk refers to risks emanating from the use of information \n",

      "usage policy, and technology skills capacity to implement cloud services \n",

      "improvement. This should cover the following areas: \n",
      " \n",
      "1. Cloud risk management \n",
      "(a) The board of a financial institution should promote and implement sound \n",
      "governance principles throughout the cloud service lifecycle in line with the \n",
      "financial institution’s risk appetite to ensure safety and soundness of the \n",
      "financial institution. \n",
      "(b) The senior management of a financial institution should develop and implement \n",
      "a cloud risk management framework that integrates with existing outsourcing \n",

      "and cyber resilience framework (CRF), for the board’s approval, proportionate \n",
      "to the materiality of cloud adoption in its business strategy, to assist in the \n",

      "Issued on: 1 June 2023 \n",
      "cloud consumer, and hence a different set of shared responsibilities. In view of \n",
      "this, the cloud risk management framework of the financial institution should : \n",

      "framework (ERM); \n",

      "the financial institution’s understanding of the specific details of the cloud \n",
      "arrangement, particularly what is or is not specified in the terms of the contract \n",
      "with the cloud service providers is essential. \n",

      "operation management as compared to on-premises IT infrastructure. \n",
      "Business processes may change and internal controls on compliance, \n",
      "business continuity, information and data security may be overlooked due to \n",
      "the ease of subscribing to cloud services. Therefore, the cloud risk \n",

      "1.1 \n",
      "Technology risk refers to risks emanating from the use of information \n",

      "1.2 \n",
      "With the more prevalent use of technology in the provision of financial \n",
      "services, there is a need for financial institutions to strengthen their technology \n",
      "resilience against operational disruptions to maintain confidence in the \n",
      "financial system. The growing sophistication of cyber threats also calls for the \n",
      "increased vigilance and capability of financial institutions to respond to \n",

      "This policy document sets out the Bank’s requirements with regard to financial \n",
      "institutions’ management of technology risk. In complying with these \n",
      "requirements, a financial institution shall have regard to the size and \n",
      "complexity of its operations. Accordingly, larger and more complex financial \n",
      "institutions are expected to demonstrate risk management practices and \n",
      "controls that are commensurate with the increased technology risk exposure \n",
      "of the institution. In addition, all financial institutions shall observe minimum \n",
      "prescribed standards in this policy document to prevent the exploitation of \n",
      "weak links in interconnected networks and systems that may cause detriment \n",
      "to other financial institutions and the wider financial system. The control \n",
      "measures set out in Appendices 1 to 5 and Appendix 10 serve as a guide for \n",
      "sound practices in defined areas. Financial institutions should be prepared to \n",

      " \n",
      "1. Cloud risk management \n",
      "(a) The board of a financial institution should promote and implement sound \n",
      "governance principles throughout the cloud service lifecycle in line with the \n",
      "financial institution’s risk appetite to ensure safety and soundness of the \n",
      "financial institution. \n",

      "cloud consumer, and hence a different set of shared responsibilities. In view of \n",

      "arrangement, particularly what is or is not specified in the terms of the contract \n",
      "with the cloud service providers is essential. \n",

RAM helps streamlining the \\nmanagement of resources within the institution, enabling centralised management of \\naccess while maintaining account-level autonomy \\nPrivileged access refers to the elevated or special permissions granted to specific users or \\nsystems that allow them to perform actions or access sensitive resources beyond what \\nstandard users can. This often includes administrative capabilities such as managing systems, \\nnetworks, and security settings, as well as accessing confidential information or performing \\ntasks critical to the infrastructure. \\nPrivileged Access Management (PAM) is a security system that controls and monitors \\naccess to sensitive systems and data by users with special, high-level permissions (like \\nadministrators). PAM ensures that only authorized users can access critical resources, limits \\nwhat they can do, and tracks their actions to prevent misuse and protect against security \\nthreats. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 4:  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5 of 10 \\n \\n4 Roles and Responsibilities \\n \\nRole \\nResponsibilities \\nWorkspace Technology Engineer; \\nRAM Administrator \\n• Manage and administrate user access \\nthroughout the entire user access lifecycle \\nPAM Administrator \\n• Manage and administrate privileged user \\naccess throughout the entire user access \\nlifecycle \\nFunctional Unit Head \\n• Review the completeness of each non-\\nprivileged user access requests initiated by \\nits unit \\n• Approve non-privileged user access requests \\nDepartment Head \\n• Review the completeness of each privileged \\nuser access requested by its department \\n• Approve privileged user access requests \\n• Review and assess the completeness and \\nappropriate of the user access matrices from \\neach system owner \\n• Review and approve user access review \\nreports \\nHuman Resource \\n• Prepare and submit user access requests for \\neach staff onboarding and offboarding  \\nSystem Owner \\n• Prepare and maintain user access matrix for \\nthe respective system \\n• Conduct periodic review of user access on \\nthe respective system \\nCybersecurity Engineering  \\n• Review and assess the completeness and \\nappropriate of the user access matrices from \\neach system owner \\nChief Technology Officer \\n• Review and approve user access review \\nreports \\n \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 5:  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n6 of 10 \\n \\n5 Access Management Overview \\n5.1 \\nThe AMP provides guidelines on the access management process and life cycle: from \\naccess provisioning, access maintenance, access deactivation, reactivation, and access \\ndeletion within the institution\\'s environment. \\n5.2 \\nAll access within the institution will be evaluated based on the need-to-know principle \\n5.3 \\nAll requests for new access or modification to existing access must be explicitly \\nauthorised by the designated authority as illustrated by the diagram below. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDiagram 1: Access Management Process \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 6:  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n7 of 10 \\n \\n6 Mandatory User Access Review \\n6.1 \\nAt least once every 12 months, all system owners are required to conduct a user \\naccess review on the respective systems under their ownership.

The policy requirements have been enhanced to provide more detailed guidance on e-KYC solutions, including requirements on the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning or other forms of predictive algorithms, reliance on human representatives, and additional safeguards for higher risk financial products.\\n1    2      Section 8.22, Appendix 3                                  New requirements have been introduced for financial institutions to ensure the technology provider appointed to provide the e-KYC solution conducts an external independent assessment on the e-KYC solution in accordance with the minimum scope and criteria specified. This is to identify the overall effectiveness and robustness of the e-KYC solution in detecting and mitigating ML/TF/PF and fraud risks.\\n2    3      Section 8.23, 8.24, 8.25         New requirements have been introduced for financial institutions to perform due diligence on the identified technology provider and the e-KYC solution prior to implementation, and to conduct an independent assessment on the financial institution\\'s own processes, procedures and controls prior to first-time implementation of an e-KYC solution. These requirements aim to ensure the overall effectiveness of e-KYC implementation.\\n3    4                    Appendix 2                                                                                                                               More detailed requirements have been introduced on the measurement and assessment of False Acceptance Rate (FAR), including the adoption of a tiered approach for FAR threshold monitoring, review and notification to the Bank. This aims to strengthen the monitoring and management of e-KYC solution performance.\\n4    5                    Appendix 4                                                      New requirements have been introduced for financial institutions to implement additional safeguards when offering higher risk financial products through e-KYC, such as current accounts, savings accounts and unrestricted investment accounts. This includes measures like requiring credit transfers from existing bank accounts and implementing ringfencing parameters to mitigate risks.>\\n\\n    \\n    '"

Glossary of Key Terms \\nThe following are the definition of key terms in this CMP:  \\nChange Advisory Committee (CAC) is the committee responsible for the approval and assessment \\nof changes.  \\nTypes of Change \\n• Ad-Hoc Change indicates a Regular Change process that is initiated on an on-demand basis \\n• Hotfix Change signifies an urgent system modification that is necessary to restore a failed \\nservice or address a potential failure that could affect customers, operations, regulatory \\ncompliance, reputation, or cause financial losses to the organization \\n• Regular Change denotes a standard change that must undergo the typical change \\nmanagement process, including planning, risk assessment, and authorization \\nChange Processes \\n• Penetration Testing is a method of testing designed to identify exploitable vulnerabilities \\nwithin the system \\n• Performance Testing is a technique used to evaluate the system\\'s performance and stability \\nunder various loads to determine whether it meets business requirements \\n• Regression Testing is a testing approach aimed at ensuring that the application system \\ncontinues to operate correctly following any code changes, updates, or enhancements \\n• System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to the methodology used for planning, \\ndesigning, developing, testing, and deploying an application system or significant \\nmodifications to an application system \\n• System Integration Testing (SIT) is the phase of testing where individual units or \\ncomponents are combined and assessed together to identify faults in the integration \\n• Unit Testing is a method of testing that focuses on verifying the functionality of individual \\ncomponents or units of the system, typically at the level of functions or methods, to ensure \\nthat each one works as expected in isolation from the rest of the system  \\n• User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is a testing method used to verify whether the specified \\nrequirements meet the business requirements as identified \\n\\n\\nPage 4:  \\n \\nINTERNAL \\n \\n \\n \\n5 of 11 \\n \\n4. Overview \\nAll changes go through structured lifecycle of change initiation, analysis, approval, development, \\ndeployment, review, and notification, as illustrated in Diagram 1. This approach is essential for \\nensuring stable and reliable services, reducing incidents related to changes, and maintaining \\ncompliance with regulatory standards. \\n \\nDiagram 1: Overview of change management lifecycle \\n\\n\\nPage 5:  \\n \\nINTERNAL \\n \\n \\n \\n6 of 11 \\n \\n5.

The policy requirements have been enhanced to provide more detailed guidance on e-KYC solutions, including requirements on the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning or other forms of predictive algorithms, reliance on human representatives, and additional safeguards for higher risk financial products.\\n1    2      Section 8.22, Appendix 3                                  New requirements have been introduced for financial institutions to ensure the technology provider appointed to provide the e-KYC solution conducts an external independent assessment on the e-KYC solution in accordance with the minimum scope and criteria specified. This is to identify the overall effectiveness and robustness of the e-KYC solution in detecting and mitigating ML/TF/PF and fraud risks.\\n2    3      Section 8.23, 8.24, 8.25         New requirements have been introduced for financial institutions to perform due diligence on the identified technology provider and the e-KYC solution prior to implementation, and to conduct an independent assessment on the financial institution\\'s own processes, procedures and controls prior to first-time implementation of an e-KYC solution. These requirements aim to ensure the overall effectiveness of e-KYC implementation.\\n3    4                    Appendix 2                                                                                                                               More detailed requirements have been introduced on the measurement and assessment of False Acceptance Rate (FAR), including the adoption of a tiered approach for FAR threshold monitoring, review and notification to the Bank. This aims to strengthen the monitoring and management of e-KYC solution performance.\\n4    5                    Appendix 4                                                      New requirements have been introduced for financial institutions to implement additional safeguards when offering higher risk financial products through e-KYC, such as current accounts, savings accounts and unrestricted investment accounts. This includes measures like requiring credit transfers from existing bank accounts and implementing ringfencing parameters to mitigate risks.>\\n\\n    \\n    '"

The key components in data management are: \\na. Data Cataloguing \\na. The process of creating a structured inventory of data assets within an \\norganization. This inventory, known as a data catalogue, serves as a \\ncomprehensive repository that provides metadata, descriptions, and context \\nabout various data sets, making it easier for users to discover, understand, \\nand utilize the data effectively.  \\nb. Key components of data cataloguing include: \\ni. Metadata Management: Capturing essential information about data \\nassets, such as data sources, formats, schemas, lineage, and \\nownership. \\nii. Data Discovery: Facilitating easy search and retrieval of data assets by \\nusers, often through a user-friendly interface or search tool. \\niii. Data Governance: Supporting data stewardship by documenting data \\nusage policies, access controls, and compliance requirements. \\niv. Collaboration and Sharing: Allowing users to contribute annotations, \\nratings, or comments, fostering a community of data users and \\nenhancing the catalogue\\'s value. \\nv. Data cataloguing helps organizations improve data accessibility, \\npromote data-driven decision-making, and enhance data governance \\nby providing a clear overview of their data landscape. \\nb. Data Architecture \\na. The structural design and framework that defines how data is collected, \\nstored, organized, integrated, and utilized within an organization. It \\nencompasses the policies, procedures, and technologies used to manage and \\ngovern data, ensuring that data assets align with business objectives and \\nsupport effective decision-making. \\nb. Key components of data architecture include: \\ni. Data Models: Frameworks that define how data is structured, \\nincluding entity relationships, data types, and schemas. This can \\ninvolve conceptual, logical, and physical data models. \\nii. Data Storage: Strategies for storing data, such as databases (relational, \\nNoSQL), data lakes, or data warehouses, and considerations for \\nperformance, scalability, and cost. \\niii. Data Integration: Methods for combining data from different sources, \\nensuring consistency and quality. This includes data ingestion, ETL \\n(Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and real-time data streaming. \\n\\n\\nPage 6:  \\nPage 7 of 10 \\n \\niv. Data Governance: Policies and procedures that dictate how data is \\nmanaged, including data quality, security, access control, and \\ncompliance with regulations. \\nv. Data Flow: The pathways and processes through which data moves \\nwithin an organization, including data sources, processing, and end-\\nuser access. Covers various aspects such as data storage for efficient \\nand secure data handling, data movement including integrations, data \\nmodelling to structure and organize data, and the management of \\nmetadata, reference data, and master data. \\nc. Data Quality \\na. The overall condition and reliability of data, determined by various attributes \\nthat assess its accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, and relevance \\nfor specific purposes. High-quality data is essential for effective decision-\\nmaking, analysis, and operational efficiency within an organization. \\nb. Key dimensions of data quality include: \\ni. Accuracy: The extent to which data correctly reflects the real-world \\nentities or events it represents. Inaccurate data can lead to misguided \\ndecisions and analysis. \\nii. Completeness: The degree to which all required data is present. \\nIncomplete data can result in a lack of insights or incorrect \\nconclusions. \\niii. Consistency: The uniformity of data across different data sources or \\nsystems. Inconsistent data can arise from multiple data entries or \\nvariations in data formats. \\niv. Timeliness: The relevance of data based on its age or freshness. \\nTimely data is essential for current decision-making, while outdated \\ndata can lead to missed opportunities or errors. \\nv. Relevance: The degree to which data is applicable and useful for the \\nintended purpose or context. Irrelevant data can clutter analysis and \\nconfuse decision-making processes. \\nvi. Validity: The adherence of data to predefined formats, rules, or \\nconstraints. Valid data conforms to expected standards, which \\nenhances its reliability \\nd. Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) \\na. The comprehensive process of managing data from its initial creation and \\nacquisition through its active use, storage, archiving, and eventual deletion or \\ndestruction. DLM encompasses the policies, practices, and technologies used \\nto ensure that data is properly handled throughout its entire lifecycle, \\noptimizing its value and ensuring compliance with regulatory and security \\nrequirements. \\nb. Key stages of the data lifecycle include: \\n\\n\\nPage 7:  \\nPage 8 of 10 \\n \\ni. Data Creation/Acquisition: The initial stage where data is generated or \\ncollected from various sources, including user inputs, transactions, \\nsensors, or external data providers. \\nii. Data Storage: The process of storing data in appropriate repositories, \\nsuch as databases, data lakes, or cloud storage, ensuring accessibility \\nand security. \\niii. Data Usage: The active phase where data is accessed, analysed, and \\nutilized for various business processes, decision-making, or reporting. \\niv. Data Sharing: The distribution of data across different users or systems, \\nensuring that the right people have access to the necessary data while \\nadhering to privacy and security policies. \\nv. Data Archiving: The process of moving infrequently accessed data to \\nlower-cost storage solutions while ensuring it remains retrievable for \\nfuture reference, compliance, or auditing. \\nvi. Data Retention and Deletion: The implementation of policies \\ngoverning how long data should be retained and the proper methods \\nfor securely deleting or destroying data that is no longer needed, in \\ncompliance with legal and regulatory requirements. \\nvii. Data Disposal: The final stage where data is permanently removed \\nfrom storage systems, ensuring that it cannot be recovered or misused. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\nPage 8:  \\nPage 9 of 10 \\n \\n6  Data Lifecycle Management \\nThe following are key guidelines for managing data throughout the entire data lifecycle: \\n6.1 \\nData Creation/Acquisition \\na.
