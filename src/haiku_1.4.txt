The policy requirements have been enhanced to provide more detailed guidance on e-KYC solutions, including requirements on the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning or other forms of predictive algorithms, reliance on human representatives, and additional safeguards for higher risk financial products. This will require the institution to review and update its internal policy to align with the new regulatory requirements."\n    },\n    {\n        "Num": 2,\n        "Affected Section/Paragraph": "Section 8.22, Appendix 3",\n        "Summary of Impact": "The new policy has introduced requirements for financial institutions to ensure the technology provider appointed to provide the e-KYC solution conducts an external independent assessment on the e-KYC solution. This will impact the institution\'s vendor management and due diligence processes, as they will need to incorporate these new requirements when selecting and onboarding e-KYC technology providers."\n    },\n    {\n        "Num": 3,\n        "Affected Section/Paragraph": "Section 8.23, 8.24, 8.25",\n        "Summary of Impact": "The new policy has introduced requirements for financial institutions to perform due diligence on the identified technology provider and the e-KYC solution prior to implementation, and to conduct an independent assessment on the institution\'s own processes, procedures and controls prior to first-time implementation of an e-KYC solution. This will require the institution to establish new procedures and controls to comply with these requirements before deploying any e-KYC solution."\n    },\n    {\n        "Num": 4,\n        "Affected Section/Paragraph": "Appendix 2",\n        "Summary of Impact": "The new policy has introduced more detailed requirements on the measurement and assessment of False Acceptance Rate (FAR), including the adoption of a tiered approach for FAR threshold monitoring, review and notification to the Bank. This will impact the institution\'s e-KYC performance monitoring and reporting processes, as they will need to implement the new FAR monitoring and management requirements."\n    },\n    {\n        "Num": 5,\n        "Affected Section/Paragraph": "Appendix 4",\n        "Summary of Impact": "The new policy has introduced requirements for financial institutions to implement additional safeguards when offering higher risk financial products through e-KYC, such as current accounts, savings accounts and unrestricted investment accounts. This includes measures like requiring credit transfers from existing bank accounts and implementing ringfencing parameters. The institution will need to update its product offering and onboarding processes to comply with these new requirements."\n    }\n]'}
